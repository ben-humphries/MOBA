# About

## Concept

We are developing a MOBA game for NVIDIA to be used for experimentation and data collection. It will likely consist of a one-lane map, minion last-hitting mechanics, towers, and the ability to change many variables and collect inputs and other useful data from an in-game interface.

## Planned technology

We will use git with Github to work together on an Unreal Engine 4.26.1 project. We chose Unreal in order to balance our ability to implement the features we'd like in a reasonable amount of time with the necessity to allow easy continued development after we leave the project.

We will also use Github Pages for this website.
